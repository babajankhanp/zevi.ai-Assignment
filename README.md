Coding Problem of Library Management System

# Problem Statement
Write a code for maintaining the lifts of a given building. 
Assume there are N lifts in a building of M floors. 
Key Params: 
Current Floor: The floor at which the lift is. 
Starting Floor: The floor from which the request was made. 
Destination Floor: The floor to which the lift must go. 
State: The lift can either be open or closed. 
Rules: 
● All the lifts are at the ground floor at the start. 
● If a lift is moving from 0th floor to the 5th floor, the lift will take 5 units of time to reach the destination floor provided the current floor of the lift is 0. 
● Lift will consume 1 unit to open to let the person in and 1 to let the person out. ● The input can be triggered at any given point in time.
